# MyFlickz 

### A full stack project built using the **MERN** stack.


#### Client Side:
The UI was built using **React**, and handles data requested by the user through the REST API [endpoints](https://github.com/kevmhughes/MyFlickz/blob/main/README.md#endpoints) defined below.

#### Server Side:
The **REST API**, and database, were built using **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

# Description
**MyFlickz** is a film buff's dream. It is essentially a database of movies, genres, and directors, where users can browse through a large selection of films and enrich their knowledge of cinema. 

### Users can:

* create an account.
* see all the movies in the database.
* get detailed information on a single movie by movie title.
* get detailed information on a genre by genre name, and view other movies in the same genre.
* get detailed information on a director by name, and view other movies from the same director.
* create a list of their favourite movies.
* update their user information.
* delete their account.
